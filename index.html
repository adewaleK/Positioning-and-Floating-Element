                   <p class="main-paragraph">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
                    with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his 
                    notebook and equations, 
                    venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                    </p>
                    <p class="main-paragraph">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles 
                    that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have
                    made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
                    evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, ca
                    using the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant 
                    </p>
                    <p class="main-paragraph">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to 
                    pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkle
                    s and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, 
                    like spit in the ocean.
                    </p>

                    <p class="main-paragraph">“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
                    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
                     Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

                        Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, 
                        including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.    
                    </p>
                    <p class="main-paragraph">
                        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark 
                        in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
                        pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open
                        vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.

                    <p class="main-paragraph">
                        Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, 
                        extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds
                        of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a 
                        larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
                        Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number 
                        of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity,
                        like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
